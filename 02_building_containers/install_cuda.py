# # Create an image with CUDA
#
# This example shows how you can create use the Nvidia CUDA base image from DockerHub.
#
# We need to install Python 3 and pip in `setup_dockerfile_commands` because the
# base image doesn't have them by default. The commands to do this are specific
# to Ubuntu 22.04 in this example.

        "RUN apt-get update",
        "RUN apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python-is-python3",

# Now, we can create a function with GPU capabilities. Run this file with
