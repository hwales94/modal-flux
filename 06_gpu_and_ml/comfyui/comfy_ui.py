# # Run ComfyUI
#
# This example shows you how to run a ComfyUI workspace with `modal serve`.
#
# If you're unfamiliar with how ComfyUI works we recommend going through Scott Detweiler's
# [tutorials on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbB33AxrcZo).

# ## Define container image
#
# Fun with ComfyUI begins with pre-trained model checkpoints.
# The checkpoint downloaded below is [huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0](https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0), but others can be used.
# The ComfyUI repository has other recommendations listed in this file:
# [notebooks/comfyui_colab.ipynb](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/notebooks/comfyui_colab.ipynb).
#
# This download function is run as the final image building step, and takes around 10 seconds to download
# the ~2.0 GiB model checkpoint.
