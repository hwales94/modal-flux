# # Fast inference with vLLM (Mixtral 8x7B)
#
# In this example, we show how to run basic inference, using [`vLLM`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
# to take advantage of PagedAttention, which speeds up sequential inferences with optimized key-value caching.
#
# `vLLM` also supports a use case as a FastAPI server which we will explore in a future guide. This example
# walks through setting up an environment that works with `vLLM ` for basic inference.
#
# We are running the [Mixtral 8x7B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) model here, which is a mixture-of-experts model finetuned for conversation.
# You can expect 3 minute second cold starts
# For a single request, the throughput is about 11 tokens/second, but there are upcoming `vLLM` optimizations to improve this.
# The larger the batch of prompts, the higher the throughput (up to about 300 tokens/second).
# For example, with the 60 prompts below, we can produce 30k tokens in 100 seconds.
#
# ## Setup
#
# First we import the components we need from `modal`.

BASE_MODEL = "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
GPU_CONFIG = gpu.A100(memory=80, count=2)


# ## Define a container image
#
# We want to create a Modal image which has the model weights pre-saved to a directory. The benefit of this
# is that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Huggingface - instead, it will take
# advantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts.
#
# ### Download the weights
#
# We can download the model to a particular directory using the HuggingFace utility function `snapshot_download`.
#
# Tip: avoid using global variables in this function. Changes to code outside this function will not be detected and the download step will not re-run.

        ignore_patterns="*.safetensors",  # vLLM doesn't support Mixtral safetensors anyway.
    )
    move_cache()


# ### Image definition
# Weâ€™ll start from a Dockerhub image recommended by `vLLM`, and use
# run_function to run the function defined above to ensure the weights of
# the model are saved within the container image.

# ## The model class
#
# The inference function is best represented with Modal's [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `__enter__` method.
# This enables us to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up, and keep it cached
# on the GPU for each subsequent invocation of the function.
#
# The `vLLM` library allows the code to remain quite clean. There are, however, some
# outstanding issues and performance improvements that we patch here, such as multi-GPU setup and
# suboptimal Ray CPU pinning.

# ```
# $ python
# >>> import modal
# >>> f = modal.Function.lookup("example-tgi-Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "Model.generate")
# >>> f.remote("What is the story about the fox and grapes?")
# 'The story about the fox and grapes ...
# ```

# ## Coupling a frontend web application
#
# We can stream inference from a FastAPI backend, also deployed on Modal.
#
# You can try our deployment [here](https://modal-labs--vllm-mixtral.modal.run).
