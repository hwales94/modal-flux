# # Stable Diffusion CLI
#
# This example shows Stable Ddiffusion 1.5 with a number of optimizations
# that makes it run faster on Modal. The example takes about 20s to cold start
# and about 1.5s per image generated.
#
# For instance, here are 9 images produced by the prompt
# `An 1600s oil painting of the New York City skyline`
#
# ![stable diffusion slackbot](./stable_diffusion_montage.png)
#
# There is also a [Stable Diffusion Slack bot example](/docs/guide/ex/stable_diffusion_slackbot)
# which does not have all the optimizations, but shows how you can set up a Slack command to
# trigger Stable Diffusion.
#
# ## Optimizations used in this example
#
# As mentioned, we use a few optimizations to run this faster:
#
# * Use [run_function](/docs/reference/modal.Image#run_function) to download the model while building the container image
# * Use a [container lifecycle method](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) to initialize the model on container startup
# * Use A100 GPUs
# * Use 16 bit floating point math


# ## Basic setup
import io
import os
import time
from pathlib import Path

import modal

# All Modal programs need a [`Stub`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub) â€” an object that acts as a recipe for
# the application. Let's give it a friendly name.

stub = modal.Stub("stable-diffusion-cli")

# We will be using `typer` to create our CLI interface.

import typer

app = typer.Typer()

# ## Model dependencies
#
# Your model will be running remotely inside a container. We will be installing
# all the model dependencies in the next step. We will also be "baking the model"
# into the image by running a Python function as a part of building the image.
# This lets us start containers much faster, since all the data that's needed is
# already inside the image.

# ## Using container lifecycle methods
#
# Modal lets you implement code that runs every time a container starts. This
# can be a huge optimization when you're calling a function multiple times,
# since Modal reuses the same containers when possible.
#
# The way to implement this is to turn the Modal function into a method on a
# class that also implement the Python context manager interface, meaning it
# has the `__enter__` method (the `__exit__` method is optional).
#
# We have also have applied a few model optimizations to make the model run
# faster. On an A100, the model takes about 6.5s to load into memory, and then
# 1.6s per generation on average. On a T4, it takes 13s to load and 3.7s per
# generation. Other optimizations are also available [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16#memory-and-speed).

# This is our Modal function. The function runs through the `StableDiffusionPipeline` pipeline.
# It sends the PIL image back to our CLI where we save the resulting image in a local file.
