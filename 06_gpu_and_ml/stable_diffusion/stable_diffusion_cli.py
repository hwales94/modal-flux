# # Run Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo from the command line

# This example shows how to run [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large-turbo) on Modal
# and generate images from your local command line.

# Inference takes about one minute to cold start,
# at which point images are generated at a rate of one image every 1-2 seconds
# for batch sizes between one and 16.

# Below are four images produced by the prompt
# "A princess riding on a pony".

# ![stable diffusion montage](./stable-diffusion-montage-princess.jpg)

# ## Basic setup

import io
import random
import time
from pathlib import Path

import modal

MINUTES = 60

# All Modal programs need an [`App`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App) â€” an object that acts as a recipe for
# the application. Let's give it a friendly name.

app = modal.App("example-stable-diffusion-cli")

# ## Configuring dependencies

# The model runs remotely inside a [container](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container).
# That means we need to install the necessary dependencies in that container's image.

# Below, we start from a lightweight base Linux image
# and then install our Python dependencies, like Hugging Face's `diffusers` library and `torch`.

image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12")

# ## Implementing SD3.5 Large Turbo inference on Modal

# We wrap inference in a Modal [Cls](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-methods)
# that ensures models are downloaded when we `build` our container image (just like our dependencies)
# and that models are loaded and then moved to the GPU when a new container starts.

# The `run_inference` function just wraps a `diffusers` pipeline.
# It sends the output image back to the client as bytes.
