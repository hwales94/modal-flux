# Modal Examples

This is a collection of examples for [Modal](https://modal.com/).

## Usage

First, sign up for a free account at [modal.com](https://modal.com/) and follow
the setup instructions to install the `modal` package and set your API key.

The examples are organized into several folders based on their category. You can
generally run the files in any folder as ordinary Python programs, with a
command like:

```bash
python -m 01_getting_started.hello_world
```

Although these scripts are run on your local machine, they'll communicate with
Modal and run in our cloud, spawning serverless containers on demand.

## Examples

* [**`01_getting_started/`**](/01_getting_started/) through [**`10_integrations/`**](/10_integrations/) provide a guided tour through Modal's concepts and capabilities.
* [**`integrations/`**](/integrations/) contains packages integrating Modal's platform with third-parties.
* [**`misc/`**](/misc/) contains uncategorized, miscellaneous examples.
* [**`ml/`**](/ml/) contains machine learning examples, including training examples and full-stack ML apps.
