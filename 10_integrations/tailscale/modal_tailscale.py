"""This example demonstrates how to integrate Modal with Tailscale (https://tailscale.com).
It outlines the steps to configure Modal containers so that they join the Tailscale network.

We use a custom entrypoint to automatically add containers to a Tailscale network (tailnet).
This configuration enables the containers to interact with one another and with
additional applications within the same tailnet.
