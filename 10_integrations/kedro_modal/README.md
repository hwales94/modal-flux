# Kedro-Modal (A plugin for Kedro)

kedro-modal is an experimental Modal plugin for Kedro (https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

The plugin lets you run Kedro Python pipelines on Modal in an effortless way.

Data in your `<project-name>/data` directory will be synced to a persisted Modal [Network File System](/docs/guide/network-file-systems) and any datasets defined as local in your Kedro data catalog will be written to the same volume.

## Installation instructions

First make sure that you have Modal installed (See https://modal.com/home)

```bash
cd modal-examples/integrations/kedro-modal
pip install .
```

This installs the kedro-modal project cli commands, e.g. `kedro modal --help`

## Usage

The following commands assume you have navigated to your kedro project, e.g.:
`cd my_kedro_project`

### Run a Kedro pipeline on Modal:

```bash
kedro modal run
```

### Reset the remote data volume using local data

```bash
kedro modal reset
```

## Inspect and download output data

### List Kedro data volumes on Modal:

```bash
modal volume list | grep '^kedro.*storage$'
```

Example output:

```
kedro.Spaceflights.storage
```

### Download an output file (example):

```bash
modal volume get kedro.Spaceflights.storage data/02_intermediate/preprocessed_shuttles.pq .
```

## Features

At this point it only supports the basic use case of running a Kedro project (equivlalent of a basic `kedro run`) on Modal instead of running it locally.

- It pushes the project source code to Modal
- Installs requirements.txt of the project in a Modal image
- Sets up a modal Network File System for syncing local input data from project/data and writing any output from the Modal runs.

### Notably missing features at this point (but should not be too tricky to handle):

- External data processors (e.g. spark)
- Parallel runs using a custom Kedro Runner subclass
- Default dataset support using Modal distributed in-memory storage (i.e. modal.Dict) - mostly needed if running parallelism
- Using Modal functions as explicit Kedro nodes/steps (should technically be doable by just using Modal as is, but would probably need some kind of integration with this plugin)
